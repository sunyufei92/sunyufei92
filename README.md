| [Python-Min-Project](https://github.com/sunyufei92/Python-Min-Project) |   This project demonstrates how to use Python's turtle graphics module to draw the American flag. The flag is composed of 13 horizontal stripes, alternating red and white, and a blue rectangle in the top left corner containing 50 white stars arranged in a grid pattern. This project is a great way to practice using turtle graphics and understanding basic programming concepts in Python.   |
